<p>
Mustread was built during a <a href="https://twitter.com/mustread/status/294496612766609408" rel="external">company-wide hackathon at Arc90.</a>. A couple of us on the Readabilty team were fans of <a href="https://www.thisismyjam.com/" rel="external">This Is My Jam</a> and decided to build the same thing for articles. The product was pretty straight-forward. Users had a profile where they could post single articles they considered to be "must reads". There were follow mechanics allowing users to see a stream of must reads posted by users they found interesting.

<p>
Not much besides a <a href="https://twitter.com/mustread" rel="external">Twitter account</a> still exists. The functionality was rolled into Readability itself with the release of the creatively named <a href="https://twitter.com/cshoe_/status/413043503954788352" rel="external">#newrdb</a>.
