<p>
    Mustread was built during a <a href="https://twitter.com/mustread/status/294496612766609408" rel="external">company-wide hackathon at Arc90.</a>. A couple of us on the Readabilty team were fans of <a href="https://www.thisismyjam.com/" rel="external">This Is My Jam</a> and decided to build the same idea for articles and use the Readability platform for parsing and parsing.

<p>
    The product was straight-forward. Users authenticated with a Readability account follow other users on the site. They could post articles they considered "must reads". Your homepage was a stream of all the recommendations posted by the users you were following. The intention being to put as much quality content in front of a user as possible.
</p>

<p>
    Unfortunately, not much still exists other than a <a href="https://twitter.com/mustread" rel="external">Twitter account</a>. The main functionality was rolled into Readability itself as Recommendations, bringing a social aspect to the reading platform.
</p>

<p>
    Much like Readability itself, Mustread was a Django app deployed on AWS using RDS's MySQL offering and Elasticache.
