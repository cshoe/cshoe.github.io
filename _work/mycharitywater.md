<p><i>my charity: water </i> was launched in time for the organization's <a href="https://www.charitywater.org/september/" rel="external">September Campaign</a> in 2009. The first month saw hundreds of fundraising campaigns and nearly $400,000 raised. By year's end, more than $1.2M had been raised on the platform through nearly 1,500 campaigns. This accounted for roughly 20% of total funds raised for water projects in 2009*.</p>

<p>The secret sauce of <i>my charity: water</i> was the ability to track donations all the way to the field. Fundraisers and donors can see exactly where their money landed complete with GPS coordinates, pictures and a description of the community.</p>

<p>On the technical side, <i>my: charity water</i> was pretty simple. The service was written in Java using a weird-ware web framework and the Freemarker template engine. Data was stored using MySQL and made more readily available in Memcached. Akamai delivered assets from the edge to decrease latency and protect the web servers from static asset requests.</p>
