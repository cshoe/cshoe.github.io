<p>
    A small team from Arc90 started worked with <a href="https://twitter.com/anildash" rel="external">Anil Dash</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/ftrain" rel="external">Paul Ford</a> and others to design and build Reuters Next, a reimagined news platform.
</p>

<p>
    Reuters Next was the most "fullstack" I've ever been on a single project. I worked on Puppet manifests, API design, async webservers and implemented UX features. I wrote docs to help the ops team at Reuters understand the deployment process and weighed in on the cross-team change management process.
</p>

<p>
    Python and the Tornado framework were used for all backend services. On the client-side Backbone, Require, Underscore and Jasmine were used.
