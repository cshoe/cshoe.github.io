<p>Quick note about my employer at the time: I joined Arc90 towards the end of 2012. It was a rad place. In addition to being an idea incubator, the company did work for everything from an insurance company to a book publisher. Take a trip to the office kitchen and you could overhear a conversation about tail call optimization or critiques of Apple's latest design decisions. The company was <a href="http://www.hypebot.com/hypebot/2013/10/sfx-entertainment-sfxe-acquires-fame-house-tunezy-and-arc90.html" rel="external">acquired by SFX</a> (now <a href="http://livestyle.com/" rel="external">LiveStyle</a>) in October 2013.</p>

<p>A small team from Arc90 started working out of the Reuters building in Times Square shortly after I started at Arc90. We joined <a href="https://twitter.com/anildash" rel="external">Anil Dash</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/ftrain" rel="external">Paul Ford</a> and others to design and build Reuters Next, a reimagined news platform. Taming the Reuters newswire was a daunting task. <a href="https://mciarlo.com" rel="external">Mike Ciarlo's</a> design chops and <a href="https://robmadole.com" rel="external">Rob Madole's</a> leadership produced some of the best work I had seen to date. The interfaces were beautiful and intuitive, the backend services were snappy. Despite <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/19/business/media/reuters-ends-plans-for-ambitious-direct-to-reader-service.html" rel="external">preview versions of the platform receiving praise</a>, Reuters <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2013/09/reuters-nixes-next-failed-redesigns-and-the-challenge-of-expanding-a-digital-audience/" rel="external">announced</a> it was scrapping the project in September 2013.</p>

<p>The foundational tech employed wasn't the sexiest but we liked it that way. Python and the Tornado framework were used for all backend services. I got my hands dirty on the client-side with Backbone, Require and Jasmine. MongoDB was used by the API layer, my first use of a NoSQL datastore in a production environment.</p>
